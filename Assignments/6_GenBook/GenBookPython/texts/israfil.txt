She’s saying now I’m 23 and I should have a degree
The favorite, the only son, but look what happened to me
The wrong path or closer to a multi-faceted dream?
I’m saying rap’s the way to sway she’s saying that’s a disease
She wants a Master from me I just want to master the keys
To open any door ahead and make it passionate themed
Who doesn’t want to exceed? But seeds need the right environment
All I wanted was a voice. Acquire what a choir sings
Dizzy and I’m tired in the tire swings
Trying to get in showbiz but the pockets skinny
Trying to find a stage and rock it to launch the city
Maybe then I’ll flip a stack but the pogs are shitty
Agonizing when I’m working in a call centre
If I’m to stand a prisoner, to fall’s better
Better to die a disobedient slave
I’d rather live for long term and not immediate gains
Do a hundred shows for nothing but a meager exchange
And become the Robitussin for a feverish game
I precede the restraints
Try to tap into my tapestry
What I'm portraying is havoc at full capacity.
