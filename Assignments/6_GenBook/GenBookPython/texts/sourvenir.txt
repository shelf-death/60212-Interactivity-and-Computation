Got many styles
This time just tryin' to follow Milo
These days, most the time
I'm chillin' in the hollow
The sea slacks
Back in high school I wanted to be abstract
Not like Q, but pretty cool
In my heart
Was always more Busy Bee than Moe Dee
Lunch line headsets had me thinking yoghurt backwards
Plug in the bathysphere
Lake Champlain is crystal clear
I owe it to myself to speak free
Kelly brought me green tea ice cream
I could never forget
Eating sushi off ten dollars
Feeling rich
That was '06
Then I wrote a lot of mean shit
But only got love in my heart
To go along with all them sad ships
That never came
But that's just life
And life is strange
How do you change the way you change the way you feel?
Rain to wash the window clear
Wipe away constellation atmosphere
Blue lagoon, my isolation
Now I'm paper plane folding
Myself into a fortune
Hoping some missing ocean will find some luck
Met Brother Question once
Life in a fish bowl leaves me floating in the punch
Just trying to stay sober
