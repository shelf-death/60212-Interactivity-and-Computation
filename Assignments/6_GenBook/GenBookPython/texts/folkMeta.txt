I should not sit on this couch and watch Netflix
I should take pouty mouth pics for my press kit
I should defy the rules of logic
I should invent some quirky new merchandise product
I just want to rap good and not sell bread sticks
I will not become a martyr for the deadbeats
I will shave my beard off by the end of this week
I will go out and learn to socialize 
and figure out why all my ex-girlfriends hate me
I'm going to put this big brain to good use
I'm going to write rap songs to find objective truths
I'm going to be better than my father
I'm going to upload well edited pictures to Flickr
I'm going to eat a lot more Fig Newtons 
and sign petitions by women's rights movements
I wish I'd met you on Legends of the Hidden Temple
I wish Hegel wasn't so incomprehensible
I wish I was more like the Ãœbermensch
I wish my fears didn't have such a putrid stench
I think my muscles should be bigger
I don't know much about Being and Nothingness
But I might just be a being of nothingness
I heard there's going to be a rap parade
