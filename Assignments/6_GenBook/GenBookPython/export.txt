The eyes open to a cry of pulleys,
And spirited from sleep, the astounded soul
Hangs for a moment bodiless and simple
As false dawn.
Outside the open window
The morning air is all awash with angels.

Some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses,
Some are in smocks: but truly there they are.
Now they are rising together in calm swells
Of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear
With the deep joy of their impersonal breathing;

Now they are flying in place, conveying
The terrible speed of their omnipresence, moving
And staying like white water; and now of a sudden
They swoon down into so rapt a quiet
That nobody seems to be there.
The soul shrinks

From all that it is about to remember,
From the punctual rape of every blessèd day,
And cries,
"Oh, let there be nothing on earth but laundry,
Nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam
And clear dances done in the sight of heaven."

Yet, as the sun acknowledges
With a warm look the world's hunks and colors,
The soul descends once more in bitter love
To accept the waking body, saying now
In a changed voice as the man yawns and rises,

"Bring them down from their ruddy gallows;
Let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves;
Let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone,
And the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating
Of dark habits,
keeping their difficult balance."


The eyes open to a cry of pulleys,
And spirited from sleep, the astounded fire
Hangs for a twinkling bodiless and mere
As mendacious begin
Outside the open window
The morning atmosphere is entire awash side angels.

Some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses,
Some are in smocks: save truly there they are.

Of calm touch filling whatever they use
of, the astute gladness of their impersonal breathing;

Now they are flying in place, conveying
The horrible speed of their omnipresence, moving
And staying similar snowy water; and now of a unusual
They swoon down into so rapt a unruffled
That no seems to be there.

From the punctual rape of all blessèd day,

Nothing save rosy hands in the rising steam
And bright dances done in the faculty of bliss

Besides, as the sun acknowledges
by a ardent behold the world's hunks and colors,
The spirit descends once more in harsh tenderness
To admit the waking trunk saying now
In a changed tone as the man yawns and rises,
