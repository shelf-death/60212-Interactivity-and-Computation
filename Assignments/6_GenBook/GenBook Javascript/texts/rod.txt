I presume that Herb means that inherently you cannot be commercial and artistic. You cannot be commercial and quality. You cannot be commercial concurrent with having a preoccupation with a level of storytelling you want to achieve, and this I have to reject. I don’t think calling something ‘commercial’ tags it with an odious suggestion that it stinks…I could’ve done probably 30 or 40 film series, I presume that I’ve turned down at least that many, with great guarantees of cash..of financial security, but I turned them down because I didn’t like them. I didn’t think they were quality, and God knows they were commercial.
